This is a simple build system explicitly for c, c++, and my own programming language Macro C (MC). it mainly is for personal use.

# Why another build system?

Because the main purpose is to build my own language. as my language is to close to those language (it compiles to C) then I guess it is worth simple write a build system for the whole family.

# What features will be supported?

this is not a replacement for CMake, it is only a personal project. an will be so minimal, but features will be added as needed.

- at start it only will be able to build executables and static libraries.
- then I probably add support for shared libs
- manage dependencies in a way that I do not know already XD.
- and create MakeFiles and Visual Studios Projects only.
